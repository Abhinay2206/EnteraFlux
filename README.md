# **EnteraFlux**

**Know Before It Hurts.**

EnteraFlux is an AI-powered metabolic safety and research intelligence platform designed to support individuals using GLP-1 metabolic medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound, etc.) by predicting adverse tolerance events, guiding behavioral interventions, detecting counterfeit drug threats, and accelerating pharmacovigilance research.

---

## **Mission Statement**

> **To make metabolic therapies safer, more tolerable, and more accessible by unlocking the physiological signals that predict treatment response.**

---

## **What EnteraFlux Does**

EnteraFlux provides a unified safety & intelligence layer for GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics through:

### **1. Predictive Tolerance Monitoring**

Uses wearable biometrics (HRV, RHR, sleep disruption, stress markers) to predict:

* nausea risk
* GI intolerance
* adherence failure
* metabolic stress

### **2. Adaptive Behavioral Guidance**

Provides real-time recommendations for:

* meal timing & composition
* hydration & electrolytes
* workout postponement
* anti-nausea strategies

### **3. Severe Risk Escalation**

If severe psychiatric risk is inferred (e.g., suicidality), system can:

* alert emergency contact (future module)

### **4. Counterfeit Drug Intelligence**

Analyzes sellers across:

* websites
* social groups
* marketplaces

to detect labeling inconsistencies and fraudulent supply chain risk.

### **5. Pharmacovigilance Intelligence**

Extracts emerging side-effect patterns from:

* Twitter/X
* Reddit
* clinical trial publications

and produces structured reports for:

* manufacturers
* CROs
* regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA, CDSCO etc.)

### **6. Research & Clinical Trial Enablement**

Provides future support for:

* cohort matching
* FHIR-compliant data exchange
* e-consent workflows

## **Brand Positioning Pillars**

1. **Predictive Safety** — We don't wait for side effects. We predict them.
2. **Physiological Intelligence** — The body produces signals. EnteraFlux interprets them.
3. **Evidence, Not Guesswork** — Decisions rooted in biomarkers, not anecdotes.
4. **Guidance Over Restriction** — We guide behavior. We never shame it.
5. **Partnership with Medicine** — We extend clinicians, not replace them.
6. **Regulatory Alignment** — Built for research. Built for safety. Built for validation.
